# Ragnarök: End-to-end RAG Baselines for TREC-RAG 25

This document describes the end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) baselines for the TREC-RAG 25 test set. All systems are grounded on the MS MARCO V2.1 segmented doc corpus curated used in the TREC 2025 RAG Track. The baselines are based on [Anserini's BM25 first-stage retrieval](https://github.com/castorini/anserini) followed by [RankLLM's multi-step RankQwen](https://github.com/castorini/rank_llm) reranking and finally, augmented-generation with Open Source Qwen 3 32B. Note that the reranking step is optional and can be skipped if you only want to use the first-stage BM25 retrieval. The generation step can also be skipped if you only plan to submit systems to the (R)etriaval subtask.

## Retrieval - BM25

The following commands show how to run Anserini's BM25 on the test set, and evaluate effectiveness, on the segmented doc corpus:

Anserini is packaged in a self-contained fatjar, which also provides the simplest way to get started. Assuming you've already got Java installed, fetch the fatjar:

```bash
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/anserini/anserini/1.1.1/anserini-1.1.1-fatjar.jar
```

```bash
export ANSERINI_JAR=anserini-1.1.1-fatjar.jar
export OUTPUT_DIR="runs"
java -cp $ANSERINI_JAR io.anserini.search.SearchCollection \
    -index msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented \
    -topics trec_rag_2025_queries.jsonl \
    -topicReader JsonString \
    -output $OUTPUT_DIR/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test.txt \
    -threads 16 \
    -bm25 \
    -hits 100 \
    -outputRerankerRequests $OUTPUT_DIR/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test_top100.jsonl &
```
        
Note the generated TREC run files (not the reranker requests JSONL file) showcase the expected output format for the (R)etrieval step.

We can check the first five lines:
```bash
head -5 runs/run.msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test.txt
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
100 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_02_1767598871#0_2981309782 1 37.058701 Anserini
100 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_18_2145512512#0_2415997336 2 34.976700 Anserini

100 Q0 msmarco_v2.1_doc_17_1744209766#0_1868981274 5 33.380001 Anserini
```
Ensure to update `Anserini` with the `run-id` your team wants associated with the run file prior to submission, if you do include such a run in your submissions.

Similarly the first line of the reranker requests file (limited to two candidates) can be checked as follows:

```bash
head -1 runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test_top100.jsonl | jq '.query, .candidates[0:2]'
```
You should see the following output:

```bash

Intersectionality is used to study, understand and respond to the ways in which gender intersects with other identities and how these intersections contribute to unique experiences of oppression and privilege. Association for Women’s Rights in Development\n“Since violence is used to control women in patriarchal societies, it is important to understand the nature of patriarchy and its relationship to other forms of oppression such as racism, colonialism, heterosexism, etc. Violence against women of color is affected by the intersection of racism and sexism and the failures of both the feminist and antiracist movements to seriously address this issue.” Crenshawe (1994) Intersectionality, Identity Politics, & Violence Against Women of Color\n“Analysis claiming that systems of race, social class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, and age form mutually constructing features of social organization, which shape Black women’s experiences and, in turn, are shaped by Black women” Collins (1990) Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment\nIntersectionality is an essential component of any activism, advocacy, curricula, services, or trainings that are aimed at serving women and dismantling patriarchal structures of violence. Prioritizing and centering the experiences of Black women, Latinx women, Indigenous women, trans women, women with disabilities, Muslim women, immigrant women, undocumented women, and gender nonconforming individuals of color is singular in achieving progress through intersectional feminism. In order to address gender-based violence, we must recognize the unique barriers that women of different backgrounds face, as they are subject to multiple layers of oppression and violence. An important application of intersectionality can be seen in the distinction between racial equality and racial equity. While “racial equality” has been traditionally used to refer to the goal of having egalitarian opportunities and rights for all individuals regardless of race, the term “racial equity” more clearly describes the actions that must be taken in order to ensure justice for communities that society has marginalized. “",

We'll be using the JSONL reranker requests files generated by the Anserini for the reranking step. These are pre-cached with document contents allowing us to offload dependencies in RankLLM. We can check their line counts as follows (number of queries):

```bash
wc -l ${OUTPUT_DIR}/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test_top100.jsonl
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
105 runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test_top100.jsonl
```

For the final AG baselines, we employ a hybrid retrieval approach combining [Splade-v3](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions/regressions-msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.splade-v3.cached.md) for sparse retrieval and [Arctic embed-l](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-v2.1-arctic.md) for dense retrieval. We will soon add exact command details here.

## Reranking - RankLLM - RankQwen3-32B

We can use RankLLM to run RankQwen3-32B on the reranker request files generated in the previous step. The following commands show how to run RankLLM on the test set:

```bash
RANK_LLM=<path-to-rank-llm>
cp runs/retrieve_results_msmarco-v2.1-doc-segmented.bm25.rag25.test_top100.jsonl ${RANK_LLM}/retrieve_results/BM25/
cd ${RANK_LLM}
pip3 install -e .
```

We show how to run RankLLM on the test set.
Let's run inference!
    
```bash
SET=rag25
python src/rank_llm/scripts/run_rank_llm.py     --model_path=Qwen/Qwen3-32B     --top_k_candidates=100     --dataset=${SET}     --retrieval_method=bm25     --prompt_mode=rank_GPT     --context_size=8192     --variable_passages     --use_alpha --num_gpus 4     --populate_invocations_history     --is_thinking
```

This should create both TREC run files and JSONL files after each pass and the final reranked JSONL files can serve as input to our augmented generation component. 
We host these files for the test set [here](https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok_data/tree/main/retrieve_results/MISC).


These files can be moved to `ragnarok`'s retrieve_results (in MISC)

Assuming these files are called
```bash
105 retrieve_results_rankqwen3_32b.rag25_top100.jsonl
10500 run.rankqwen3_32b.rag25.txt
```

```bash
cp ../rank_llm/rerank_results/BM25/retrieve_results_rankqwen3_32b.rag25_top100.jsonl retrieve_results/MISC/
cp ../rank_llm/rerank_results/BM25/run.rankqwen3_32b.rag25.txt retrieve_results/MISC/
```

## Generation - Open Source Qwen 3 32B

The following commands show how to run the augmented generation step with Qwen 3 32B on the test set with the official prompt:

```bash
SET=rankqwen3_32b.rag25
python src/ragnarok/scripts/run_ragnarok.py  --model_path=Qwen/Qwen3-32B  --topk=20 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=mis
c --prompt_mode=ragnarok_v4  --context_size=16384 --max_output_tokens=8192 --run_id fs_rank-qwen3-32b_ag-qwen3-32b --num_gpus 4 --vllm_batched; 
```

We can also run this with top-50 candidates by replacing the topk argument with 50.

```bash
SET=rankqwen3_32b.rag25
python src/ragnarok/scripts/run_ragnarok.py  --model_path=Qwen/Qwen3-32B  --topk=50 --dataset=${SET}  --retrieval_method=misc --prompt_mode=ragnarok_v4  --context_size=32768 --max_output_tokens=8192 --run_id fs_rank-qwen3-32b_ag-qwen3-32b-top50 --num_gpus 4 --vllm_batched; 
```

This should create a file in `results/MISC` and `rag_execution_summary/MISC` with the AG results.


### Converting to AG/RAG Output Format
To ensure compatibility with the expected TREC RAG 2025 format, it is recommended to use the `src/ragnarok/scripts/convert_to_trec25_format.py` script to convert generation results produced by Ragnarök.

You can convert these to the official RAG25 submission format by running the following command:
```bash
python src/ragnarok/scripts/convert_to_trec25_format.py --input_file <path/to/result_file> --output_file <path/to/output_file> --prompt_file <path/to/exec_summary_file>
```

### Verifying AG/RAG Output

We recommend running `src/ragnarok/scripts/check_trec_rag25_gen.py` to verify the output adheres to the expected format. This is our checking script for RAG/AG tracks. You can see if your systems conform to it. The script will maintain an errorlog and in the case of some cases also attempt to fix warnings (too long -> we remove sentences from the end, dupe citations -> we remove them, etc.). You’ll get a fixed file if the errors are not major that you can resubmit but please go through all the warnings and error messages to make sure you and the script are doing things *as expected*!
```bash
python3 src/ragnarok/scripts/check_trec_rag25_gen.py --input ragnarok_data/rag25/results/MISC/baseline_rag25.test_Qwen3-32B_16384_20_ragnarok_v4_rankqwen3_32b.rag25.jsonl --format 1 --topics trec_rag_2025_queries.jsonl
